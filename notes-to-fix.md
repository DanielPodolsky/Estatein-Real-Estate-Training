To fix:
1. Add the second background behind the blue blocks. (hero top images)
2. Ask about the grid system implemented in figma?
3. How to make more space between title and paragraph in hero mid / hero end?
4. shadow-box in hero-end isn't working
5. <!-- Maybe put featured-title and featured-description in one, single div? -->
6. read-more button isn't changing CSS
7. hero-mid doesnt start from the sides. (its centered instead of space between?)
8. Change property to display: flex to maintain vertical alignment.
9. Change every "Review" to "Testimonials" in code.
