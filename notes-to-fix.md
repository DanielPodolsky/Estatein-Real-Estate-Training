NOTES:

# Currently I am working on the hero section #

Next thing to do:
## Mobile ##
* F.A.Q (Frequently Asked Questions) -> Design question's section's classes.


To fix:
1. Add the second background behind the blue blocks. (hero top images)
2. Ask about the grid system implemented in figma?
3. How to make more space between title and paragraph in hero mid / hero end?
4. shadow-box in hero-end isn't working
5. <!-- Maybe put featured-title and featured-description in one, single div? -->
6. read-more button isn't changing CSS
7. hero-mid doesnt start from the sides. (its centered instead of space between?)
8. Change property to display: flex to maintain vertical alignment.
9. Change every "Review" to "Testimonials" in code.
10. Have a specific button class...
11. Make the ul at the footer look like we want (Like in figma)


*NEW* To Fix:
1. Border-bottom of header-top to remove it after user clicks the X button.



Completed:

Problems I had and the answers to them!

1. Background image for the site; Don't put them in the CSS Reset. Instead, put the background image in the body.
2. Not a problem, but good video for hamburger :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8smiWQ8Seg (Coding2Go)
3. align-items: stretch; Makes the flex items have the height of the tallest flex item so they all align together nicely.
